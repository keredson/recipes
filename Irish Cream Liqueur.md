Irish Cream Liqueur
===================

- 1 750ml bottle whiskey
- 1 14oz can of condensed milk
- 1 12oz can evaporated milk
- 1/2c heavy cream
- 100g honey
- 2 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tbsp instant coffee

Blend, bottle, refrigerate, and serve over ice.

The original recipe called for 2 cans sweetened condensed milk instead of one can plus one can of evaporated. 
I was afraid that would be too sweet. But then I wound up doubling the honey so maybe it would be good to try?
