Japanese Milk Bread (Tangzhong Method)
=====
This recipe uses the Tangzhong method, a type of roux, to create incredibly soft and fluffy bread. It's a popular technique for Japanese milk bread (Hokkaido milk bread) and results in a lighter texture and extended freshness. 
Ingredients: 

Tangzhong (Water Roux): 
60 mL (¼ cup) water
60 mL (¼ cup) milk
23 g (2 tbsp) bread flour 

Japanese Milk Bread Dough: 
Tangzhong (at room temperature)
120 mL (½ cup) milk, lukewarm
7 g (2 - 2 ¼ tsp) active dry yeast
50 g (¼ cup) sugar
15 g (2 tbsp) dry milk powder (optional)
1 egg
350 g (about 2 ⅔ cups) bread flour, spoon and leveled
1 tsp sea salt
58 g (4 tbsp / ½ stick) unsalted butter, softened 

1. Make the Tangzhong
Place the water in a small saucepan, add the bread flour, and whisk until smooth and lump-free.
Add the rest of the milk and whisk to combine.
Heat over medium heat while whisking constantly until the mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency.
Remove from heat, scrape into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap (touching the surface), and let cool to room temperature. 
3. Activate the Yeast (if using active dry):
Dissolve 1 tsp of the sugar in the lukewarm milk in your mixing bowl. Add the active dry yeast, stir, and let sit for about 10 minutes until foamy. 
4. Make the Dough:
If using instant yeast, add it with the lukewarm water from the yeast activation step (if skipping) at this stage. Add the remaining sugar, milk powder (if using), cooled tangzhong, egg, flour, and salt. Mix with a spatula until combined. Using a dough hook on a mixer, knead on low speed for about 5 minutes. Gradually add the softened butter, mixing between additions. Increase speed to medium and knead for another 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the bowl. 
5. First Rise (Bulk Fermentation):
Shape the dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled (about 1-2 hours). Alternatively, refrigerate for a slower rise. 
6. Shape the Bread:
Gently deflate the dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Divide into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 10x6 inch rectangle and roll into a log starting from the short end. 
7. Second Rise (Proofing):
Place the logs seam-side down in a greased loaf pan. Cover and let rise until puffy. 
8. Bake:
Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the top with an egg wash (1 small egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water). Bake for 30-40 minutes until golden brown. Cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely.
