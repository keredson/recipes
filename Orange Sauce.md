- ~350g tomato
- 1 yellow onion
- 1 head garlic
- 1 cup oil
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/3 cup white vinegar
- 1 tbsp salt

Broil tomato and onion until lightly charred.

Saute peppers and garlic with some of the oil until slightly browned.

Blend everything except the remaining oil.  Stream in
remaining oil.  (The garlic will emulsify everything.)
