Orange Sauce
============

Inspired by [La Victoria Taqueria](http://www.lavicsj.com/), but spicier.

- 50g arbol peppers (dried, roughly chopped, about 1 cup)
- ~350g tomato
- 1 yellow onion
- 1 head garlic
- 1 cup oil
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/3 cup white vinegar
- 1 tbsp salt

Broil tomato and onion until lightly charred.

Saute peppers and garlic with some of the oil until slightly browned.

Blend everything except the remaining oil.  Stream in
remaining oil.  (The garlic will emulsify everything.)

Yield: ~24 fl oz

Refridgerate overnight before use.  (To hydrate/soften the blended pepper pieces.)

Notes
-----

Do we really need arbol peppers?  (Would bird's eyes work?)  Maybe fresh peppers?

Yep!

Canned diced tomatoes also work.  Different taste, but reasonable.
