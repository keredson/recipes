Salsa Verde
===========

- 1 lb tomatillos, husks removed and rinsed
- 4 birds eye peppers
- medium white onion
- 4-8 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, leaves and stems
- 2 tsp salt
- juice ~3 limes
- 1/8 tsp citric acid (optional)

It should approximately fill a blender. Blend until smooth. 

Some recipes suggest a tbsp of oil. This is unnecessary and detracts from their freshness.
