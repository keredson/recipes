==========================

We esp. like this for breakfast.

Ingredients
-----------
- ~5 ripe tomatoes
- 1 bundle of scallions
- 1 cup flour
- oil
- 3-4 eggs
- 6 cups water
- ~1.5 tsp. salt (to taste)

Prepare
-------
1. Add the flour to a bowl and drizzle in water while mixing, until lots of little clumps form.  This is the trickiest part of the recipe, and 
takes less water than you think.  It should look like this:

2. Chop scallions, keeping the white and green parts separate.
3. Cut the tomatoes into wedges (8ths if using regular sized).
4. Beat the eggs by themselves (as if to scramble them).

Directions
----------
1. Add a few tbsps of oil to a pot or wok.  Heat.
2. Add the white parts of the scallions and lightly fry.
3. Add the tomatoes.  Cook them until tender / slightly reduced.  They should look like this:

4. Add the water and most but not all of the salt.  Bring to a boil.
5. Sprinkle in the dough balls slowly.  Alternate: sprinkle, let them boil, mix them in, etc. 
until they're all in.  If you mix too fast (before they cook a bit) they'll dissolve.  If you sprinkle too much at one time they'll clump.
You want lots of little dough balls in the soup.
6. While still boiling, drizzle in some of the beaten eggs slowly, with a thin stream in a spiral.  Don't overlap the stream,
and don't mix.
7. Let the boiling water cook it.  It will puff up the egg bits.  Once cooked, mix.
8. Repeat 6-7 until you've added all the egg.  This usually takes 3-4 times.
9. Add remaining salt to taste.
10. Mix in remaining scallions and turn off the heat.

Let cool a bit before serving if you want it hot.  Or let it cool all the way for the more refreshing version.
(We often do both, for breakfast then kunch.)  It will thicken as it cools.
