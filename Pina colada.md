Pina Colada
=====

- 1 can coconut milk
- juice of one lime
- ~133 calories worth of some kind of sugar (honey, agave syrup, etc.)
- 1 cup silver tequila
- 2 cups frozen pineapple chunks
- 2 cups ice

Can substitute 1 scoop of country time lemonade for the sugar and lime if you don't have lime. (And are feeling redneck!)
