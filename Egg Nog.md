Egg Nog
========
Makes about 1 quart.

- 1 cup cream
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup rum
- 1/2 cup whiskey
- nutmeg for garnish

Sous vide the eggs for 75 minutes at 135°F.

Whip the first cup of cream in a small bowl.
In a big bowl, beat the eggs and slowly
drizzle in the alcohol until incorporated — 
don't stop mixing, or the eggs will curdle. 
~It's important to mix the alcohol directly into the eggs to kill bacteria.~ 
Mix in the sugar, un-whipped cream or milk and the whipped cream until smooth. 

Transfer the eggnog to a vessel that will 
allow gas to escape and chill in the
refrigerator for about three weeks —
aging will kill bacteria and enhance the flavor. 
The mixture will separate a bit as it sits, 
so stir it back up before pouring into glasses. 
Sprinkle nutmeg over top, if you're into that.
