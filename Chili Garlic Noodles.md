Make noodles (recommend fresh).  For the sauce:

- 1 head garlic minced
- 1 tbsp korean crushed pepper powder (prob. any crushed red pepper will do)
- 2 tsp sesame seeds (crushed)
- 2-3 bird's eye chillies (chopped)
- 1/2 bundle scallions, chopped
- 2 tsp honey
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp regular soy sauce
- 1 tbsp chinese black vinegar
- 1/2 tsp MSG
- 1/3 cup oil

1. Mix all ingredients except the oil and the noodles in a metal bowl.  
2. Heat the oil to 350Â°F.  
3. Pour over other ingedients, stirring quickly. (This will bubble violently.)
4. Mix in noodles.

To try:
- A whole bundle of scallions?
- Less crushed pepper, maybe all fresh pepper?
- 2x the honey?
- Ground meat (a la ants on a tree)?
