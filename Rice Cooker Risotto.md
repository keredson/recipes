Rice Cooker Risotto
===================

- 3/4 rice cup of rice
- Chicken stock up to the 1.5 line (2x normal for the rice)
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp salt (more if low sodium stock)
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- a handful of shiitake or other mushrooms (sliced)

Cook the rice in the rice cooker. When done add: 
- 1 tbsp butter
- approximately a half a cup of frozen peas

Makes a generous portion for one person. Scale for the number of people.
This does not keep well in the fridge for leftovers so only cook what you intend to eat.
