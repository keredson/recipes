=======

Ingredients
-----

- 5 garlic cloves (fermented)
- 1 red onion (fermented)
- 1/2 bird's eye pepper (fermented)
- 2 tbsp butter
- 28oz canned tomatoes with juice
- 1c chicken stock
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tbsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2c milk

Directions
----
1. Sauteed garlic, onion, bird's eye pepper in the butter.
2. Add stock, tomatoes, bay leaf, black pepper and basil.
3. Boil for 5 mins or until tender.
4. Remove bay leaf.
5. Blend until smooth.
6. Add milk.

Notes
---
The milk chunked up. Maybe add after it cooled down? Or possibly it was the acid, or maybe I need to add before blending.

The fermented is probably optional. It's just what I had laying around.

Is removing the bay leaf necessary? It seemed still full of flavor.

This was *really* good despite the notes.  Maybe pair with some country bread.
